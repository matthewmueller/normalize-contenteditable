# normalize-contenteditable

  All text in a content-editable block should be wrapped in `<p>` tag. Each browser handles content-editables just a bit different. The goal of this library is to normalize these inconsistencies.

## Installation

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install matthewmueller/normalize-contenteditable

## Example

```js
var normalize = require('normalize-contenteditable');
normalize(editor, 'Let this paper be your oyster...');
```

## API

### Normalize(el, [placeholder])

Initialize `normalize` on the contenteditable element `el`. Optionally pass some `placeholder` text when the contenteditable element has no content. By default `placeholder` is a [zero-width space (u200B)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space).

### Normalize#unbind()

Unbind all attached events.

## TODO

* firefox select all deletes the placeholder paragraph
* IE9+ testing
* functional tests
